Redeploying a WAR project
The goals required to redeploy a WAR project depend upon how it was deployed:

To redeploy a WAR project deployed by tomcat:deploy you can type:
	mvn package tomcat6/7:redeploy
To redeploy a WAR project deployed by tomcat:exploded you can type:
	mvn war:exploded tomcat6/7:redeploy
To redeploy a WAR project deployed by tomcat:inplace you can type:
	mvn war:inplace tomcat6/7:redeploy
To redeploy a context.xml file deployed by tomcat:deploy you can type:
	mvn tomcat6/7:redeploy
Note: Depending on the docBase specified in the context.xml you may also need to call war:exploded or war:inplace as above.
